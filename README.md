# Hyperparameter-Tuning
This coding challenge focuses on enhancing classification model performance by tuning hyperparameters, employing techniques like grid search.
The objective is to apply hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy and evaluate model performance with the tuned parameters. 
Throughout the challenge, tasks include data loading, preprocessing, model training using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), defining a custom metric (log-loss) for evaluation, and finally, optimizing the SVC's hyperparameters through grid search to enhance model performance.
